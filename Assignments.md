# Assignments and Deliverables #

## Inception: Due next Wednesday (Sept 29, 2010) ##
  * ### [Vision Statement](Vision.md) ###

> The vision statement, also known as a project charter, should include an elevator summary of the project, a business case for the project (including a short analysis of the competition, market space, or similar commercial off the shelf software), a description of the project stakeholders, a list of the major features of the completed project, and a list of the major risks of the project.

  * ### [Use Cases (20% complete)](UseCases.md) ###

> A list of all Use Cases with at least 20% fully dressed, as discussed in class, and the texts. Fully dressed use cases include, at the minimum, name, ID, actors, brief description, pre- and post-conditions, as well as a full main sequence of events with numbered steps and system responses for each step. Additionally, include extensions and branching, if appropriate.

  * ### [Glossary](Glossary.md) ###

> A comprehensive list of the domain terms used within your project. Include informative, clear definitions of each term.

  * ### [Project Schedule](Schedule.md) ###

> A detailed schedule of the phases and iterations of your project. You must include iterations and dates for the development of each use case or feature, as well as estimates of the time required to complete each item on the schedule. The schedule must show the specific dates each phase and iteration ends. Also include preliminary details and timing of the tasks included in completing your project.

  * ### [Project Budget](Budget.md) ###

> Even though we can't pay you to complete your project, you need to develop a project budget which shows how much money you would need to develop your project if someone were paying you to do so. You should include the cost of any materials which you may need to purchase, such as software, hardware, or any other resources necessary for the project or team. You must also show your staffing costs (salary/paychecks). The budget must be presented in terms of US dollars, as that is the local currency. Attempt to make this as realistic as possible, although creativity leeway is provided.
